# Native Interfaces setup example

This project contains usage examples of native interfaces in different programming languages.
The core setup is a shared c-library that contains all basic code interaction mechanisms (in this case greeting persons). This shared library is on the one hand generated via different programming languages and on the other hand integrated into different programming languages via native interfaces.

## To shared library
All subfolders of the to-library folder contain programming examples that produce the shared library.

## From shared library
All subfolders of the from-library folder contain programming examples demonstrating how to integrate a shared library via native interfaces.
